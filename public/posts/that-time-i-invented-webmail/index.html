  <div class="post-content"><p>In early 1997 I was working at a hosting company&ndash;my first real job in technology.  My dream job.</p>
<p>Back then, few people carried a laptop because they were still quite large, heavy, and underpowered which meant I had a company-provided desktop computer (also large and heavy) at the office and then my personal machine at home. There was little in the way of email syncing since most email accounts used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol">POP</a> instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol">IMAP</a> for some reason.</p>
<p>One day I thought, &ldquo;It would be great if I could check my work email from my browser.&rdquo; which was a lightbulb moment for me.  Why <em>couldn&rsquo;t</em> I check it from my browser?</p>
<p>I started working on it.</p>
<p>Today I could picture in my head the code I would need to write to accomplish such a task but, back then, I was still too new.  I mocked up the HTML since that&rsquo;s what I knew the best.  I think I probably planned on using PHP as the backend language since a co-worker had written <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961221141253/http://atlantamls.com/">AtlantaMLS</a> using PHP (version 1) and mSQL and I could ask him questions when I got stuck.</p>
<p>Then, one day, a terrible thought occurred.  That one that we all get.  The self-doubt root of imposter syndrome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would anybody want this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I believed that thought and dropped the project.  A few months later, Hotmail sold for (inflation adjusted) $700 million to Microsoft.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s not kid ourselves.  I didn&rsquo;t have the business experience to parlay my project into a huge exit, even in the frothy days of the early web.  That&rsquo;s not the problem.  The problem is, I gave up on myself.  I hit a roadblock and used that to convince myself that nobody would want such a product.</p>
<p>What I should have done&hellip; well, what I should&rsquo;ve done is market research right from the start which would have told me that <strong>of course</strong> people would want such a product! Then I wouldn&rsquo;t have had that particular piece of ammunition to use against myself when doubt crept in. When it inevitably did, the next thing I should have done is explored where those feelings are coming from and disobeyed the fear.</p>
<hr>
<p>A few years later I was talking to my grandfather and I told him my story.  He relayed his own version of that story, though without the self-doubt and a lot more intrigue:</p>
<p>In the late 60&rsquo;s my grandfather had sold an insurance company and had started a successful real estate and residential home construction business.  One day, in the early 70&rsquo;s, a guy who he knew to be &ldquo;a crook&rdquo; stopped by his office and offered my grandfather an opportunity to go in with him on some scheme he was planning.  My grandfather told the guy he wanted nothing to do with it and threw him out.</p>
<p>A few months pass and this same guy calls my grandfather up. &ldquo;I just wanted to thank you for not turning me in on that deal.  As thanks, I want you to buy up as much property as you can in this area of downtown [Atlanta].&rdquo;  My grandfather laughed at him for several reasons.  See above: this guy had a less-than-stellar reputation but, also because the area the guy was telling him to buy was a shanty town.  Sure, he could&rsquo;ve gotten the property for cheap but, why? He told the guy as much and hung up on him.</p>
<p>Today that part of town is called CNN Center and the city passed the law making it so a few months after that phone call.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t blame my grandfather for doing what&rsquo;s right and I don&rsquo;t think he regretted it.  The guy was a crook after all.</p>
<hr>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really regret not &ldquo;inventing&rdquo;[1] webmail. What I regret is not learning sooner how to disobey my fear. Also, my grandfather has been dead for 18 years now and I wish I had asked him for more stories.</p>
<p>1: A lot of people invented it, really.  It was such an obvious idea.</p>
